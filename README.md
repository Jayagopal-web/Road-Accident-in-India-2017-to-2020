# Road Accidents in India From 2017 to 2020

I conducted **data gathering** from the Open Government Data Platform (OGD) India, collecting a total of **13 datasets**. Subsequently, I implemented **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to seamlessly transform this data into a structured format conducive to comprehensive analysis. My responsibilities also included conducting **data modeling** across these 13 datasets to establish critical relationships between accident data, injuries, fatalities, and other relevant variables. To facilitate effective communication of these insights, I developed a **data visualization** strategy and created an **interactive Power BI dashboard**. This dashboard served as a dynamic platform for showcasing key findings and trends, underlining the significance of data design and management in the process.
